# Transfer zip file to Android sdcard

This Applescript project was written specifically to transfer the Nexus 5X image bundle found [here](https://developers.google.com/android/images) to /sdcard/updatestuff for easy flashing with FlashFire.

It can be used to transfer other zip files to the same location.

# Dependencies

Android Debug Bridge (adb) must be located in /usr/local/bin. I suggest installing it from [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) by running `brew install android-platform-tools`in terminal after Homebrew is installed.
